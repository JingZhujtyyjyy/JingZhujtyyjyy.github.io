  title={Psychological Compensation of Drinking Poison to Quench Thirst: The Dual Effects of Smartphone Use Habits on Depression in CHinese Left-Behind Adolescents},
  author={Jing Zhu and Rui Wang},
      abstract={This study investigates the dual effects of smartphone use habits on depression among Chinese left-behind adolescents. Based on a field survey of 848 adolescents, the study finds that frequent, prolonged, and recreational smartphone use—via increasing dependence—leads to social anxiety, stress, and sleep disorders, thereby worsening depression. While social smartphone use enhances online social support, it fails to alleviate loneliness or depression. The findings suggest that digital companionship may offer limited emotional relief, highlighting the importance of offline social support in promoting adolescents’ mental well-being.},

  title={Focusing and Decentralizing: A study on the mechanism of emotional impact on network agenda setting(聚焦与分散：情绪对网络议程设置影响机制研究)},
  author={Han Qing Ding and Jing Zhu*},
  abstract={This study explores how emotional valence shapes the network agenda-setting process. While traditional agenda-setting theory has emphasized cognition, we highlight the overlooked role of emotion. Through experiments, we find that negative emotions narrow cognitive focus and weaken media–audience agenda correlations (focusing effect), whereas positive emotions encourage more balanced attention and strengthen these correlations (dispersing effect). These findings suggest that future agenda-setting research should integrate emotional dynamics, and public communication should carefully balance factual expression with emotional appeal to avoid pitfalls like post-truth and group polarization.},

  title={Between Staying and Leaving: Interaction Mechanisms Among Bilibili Dropout Creators（去留之间：B站中辍up主‘主客我互动机制研究’},
  author={Han Qing Ding and Jing Zhu},
  abstract={This study analyzes the farewell videos of Bilibili creators who have temporarily or permanently stopped posting ("dropout creators") to explore their interaction with platform algorithms, audiences, and digital environments. It reveals that these creators face an unstable and demanding "Other-self," composed of opaque algorithms, boundary-blurring viewers, and fluid platform dynamics. This strained relationship triggers anxiety and burnout in their "Subject-self." In response, creators adopt either withdrawal or adjustment strategies to restore balance, leading to common phenomena such as long breaks or account abandonment. The findings suggest that while digital identities offer flexibility, they also complicate creators’ relational networks and emotional well-being.},

  title={How User Visibility Aﬀects Peer Production（用户可见性对大众生产影响机制研究）},
  author={Han Qing Ding and Jing Zhu},
  abstract={This study takes Baidu Baike as a case to explore how peer production becomes possible on digital platforms. Using online ethnography and participatory observation, it examines user visibility as a key mechanism. The platform differentiates user visibility through data redistribution and rule design, shaping weak ties (between producers and viewers) and strong ties (among producers) based on who sees and is seen. These ties generate three core motivations: to produce higher-quality content, to produce more content, and to sustain long-term production. The study proposes a "visibility–relation–motivation" framework, revealing the relational dynamics behind peer production beyond the simplistic platform–user power binary.},

  author={Han Qing Ding and Jing Zhu},
  abstract={Drawing on the theory of frontstage–backstage and ethnomethodology, this study uses online ethnography and participatory observation to explore how norms are performed and constructed in Baidu Baike’s literary editing community. The backstage is divided into a “middle stage” for power negotiation and a “deep backstage” for building intimacy. These distinct interaction goals give rise to different types of norms, shaped by both platform rules and members’ tacit normative awareness. Norms are constructed through performative cues, role modeling by opinion leaders, and repeated feedback. The findings reveal a dynamic tension between norm construction and deconstruction, which continuously drives collaborative production on the platform.},

  title={Who Stirred Up Online Emotion? Key Nodes in the Spread of Anger in Online Public Opinion（谁掀动了网络情绪——网络舆情中愤怒情绪传播的关键节点）},
  author={Nian Liu and Jing Zhu},
  abstract={Following the “RYB Kindergarten child abuse incident,” a surge of public anger erupted on Weibo. Using machine learning–based emotion recognition and social network analysis, this study examines key nodes in the spread of anger from three perspectives: node roles, actor types, and mechanisms of influence. The anger diffusion network exhibits a radial structure, with a few users in dominant positions. News media and celebrities serve as emotional initiators with high attraction power, while grassroots influencers act as emotional hubs with strong cohesion. Together, their interactions shift the flow of online discourse from facts and opinions toward emotions, shaping a multi-actor emotional landscape in online public opinion.},

  author={Han Qing Ding and Jing Zhu},
  abstract={"This study uses web scraping, content analysis, and social network analysis to examine emotional framing on Chinese social media during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, grounded in the agenda-setting theory. Key findings include: (1) institutional media and opinion leaders effectively shape grassroots emotions; (2) negative emotions are more influential than positive ones in framing effects; (3) institutional media are better at setting neutral and positive emotions, while opinion leaders excel in setting negative emotions. The study expands third-level agenda-setting theory by emphasizing the power of emotion and offers practical insights for guiding online public opinion in emotionally charged environments. “},

My paper on left-behind adolescents’ mental health was selected as one of the top 35 papers out of 927 submissions at the 19th China Youth Development Forum. It was awarded Third Prize and I was invited to present it on-site in Xi’an.

This study continues my research focus on adolescent mental well-being, particularly examining the psychological challenges faced by left-behind youth in rural areas.

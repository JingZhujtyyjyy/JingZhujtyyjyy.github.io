<p>At ICA 2024, I presented my study on how smartphone use affects adolescent mental health, asking whether digital engagement serves as psychological compensation or leads to negative outcomes like drinking poison to quench thirst. </P>

<p>This research was based on fieldwork I conducted in my hometown, where I collected first-hand data from local adolescents. It explores how different usage patterns relate to mental health indicators such as loneliness, anxiety, and depression.</p>

<p>The paper was awarded Second Place in the Student Paper Competition by the Health Communication Division, and I received a registration fee waiver in recognition of this achievement.</p>

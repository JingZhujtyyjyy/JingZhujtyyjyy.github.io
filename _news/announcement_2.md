Title: Breaking the Silence: A Study on the Mediating Role of Psychological Factors Between Perceptions of the Internet Public Sphere and Online Expression
Conference: Expression and Debates in Politics, Political Communication Division
Date: June 14, 2025
Location: Denver, United States

I was delighted to present my latest research at the Expression and Debates in Politics conference on ICA.

My presentation, [Breaking the silence: A study on the mediating role of psychological factors between perception of the internet public sphere and online expression], examined how individuals' perceptions of the online public sphere --- specifically its civility, inclusiveness, and rationality --- influence their willingness to express themselves. This study expands the Spiral of Silence theory by adding online-specific factors and helps explain why some people choose to express their views online while others stay silent.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Communication at [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/).

I also recieved my Master degree at [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/) where I was advised by [Prof. Hanqing Ding](https://sjc.bnu.edu.cn/sztd/jsdw/js/112491.html). Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mike Yao](https://media.illinois.edu/yao-mike/).

My research primarily focuses on **media sociology**, with specific interests in:
- Media use and adolescent mental health
- Peer production communities
- Emotion and online public opinion

My research has been shared through publications in journals like Health Communication (SSCI) and 新闻与传播研究, presentations at international conferences including ICA and AEJMC, and has been generously recognized with honors such as the First Prize at the 8th Political Communication Forum and my school's "Top Innovative Talent" award.

I am about to graduate at December. 2025 and will be on the job market. If you're interested, feel free to reach out via [my_email](jingzhu7410@gmail.com).
